== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1. What is Scr.im? =
You may read more about Scr.im on its [about page](http://scr.im/about/).

= 2. How do I change the Email addresses for the comments or bbPress posts that have been already posted? =
Well, there is really no method, but you may edit the comment or bbPress post which has email IDs, and then click update (even without editing anything) - this would make the plugin run its email ID search on that content again.

= 3. If I disable the plugin, will all the scr.im URLs vanish? =
No.


You may also read some questions on the scr.im's [FAQ page](http://scr.im/faq/).
